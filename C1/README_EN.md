# Rust Exercises: Volume 1

This directory contains exercise sets and supporting materials for learning Rust with different levels of proficiency. Each set consists of a file with exercise descriptions and a file with hints and/or model solutions.

## What sets are there for me to choose?

### `set_1` - exercises for beginners

- **set_1.md** should help you get a better understanding of Rust's fundamentals.
- **rust_beginner_help.md** explain basic concepts and help you do the `set_1.md` exercises. They contain code snippets, and in some cases, model solutions.

### `set_2` - intermediate exercises

- **set_2.md** focuses on more complex Rust concepts.
- **rust_intermediate_help.md** explain structs, iterators, `enum`s, working with HTTP servers and more.

### `set_3` - advanced exercises

- **set_3.md** requires an understanding of advanced concepts like `async executor`s or custom memory management systems.
- **rust_advanced_help.md**: explains working with `Future`, `Waker`, `Poll`, memory management, as well as data serialization and deserialization using `serde`.

## How to use the materials?

1. **Start with `set_X.md` file** (where X means proficiency level, eg. `1`, `2` or `3`) and read the task descriptions.
2. Try to do these exercises on your own. If you're stuck, take a look at `rust_X_help.md`.
3. If you're still struggling with some exercise, feel free to use the help channel in our Discord, or email us all your other solutions and we'll try and help you during the office hours.
